# I am making an animated map that shows 
# Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000 live births) for every country
# Using world bank data here https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?view=chart
# You can do this for whatever indicator you feel like

# Let's get some boundaries for the world from the World Bank https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-bank-official-boundaries
# I am using a lowres geojson
curl -o wb-shapefile.zip https://development-data-hub-s3-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ddhfiles/779551/wb_boundaries_geojson_lowres.zip

# let's unzip it 
unzip wb-shapefile.zip

# let us merge our geojson with our data
# keys mention which ID to match on for our first dataset, and then our second dataset
# -o says which file to output this to
mapshaper WB_Boundaries_GeoJSON_lowres/WB_countries_Admin0_lowres.geojson -join world-child-mortality.csv keys=ISO_A3,code -o out.geojson

# There are these things called projections. They make our data look a certain way
# Let's check which all projections we have 
mapshaper -projections

# I like natural earth. so going to change my data to that projection using the -proj flag
mapshaper out.geojson -proj natearth -o projection.json

# Let us test out a map. 
# -colorizer defines a function to calculate colors based on breaks. we give the function a name.
# And then we give our buckets some colors 
# And then we define the breaks
# we call the function and give our svg a fill.
# We use the d["2021"] format because our column header is a number. 
# The \ in the end make sure we escape the enter that comes after it. 
# If we wrote the thing in a whole long line. That would work too.
mapshaper projection.json \
	-colorizer name=getColor colors='#f0f9e8,#bae4bc,#7bccc4,#2b8cbe' \
		breaks=25,50,75 \
	-style fill='getColor(d["2021"])' \
	-o output.svg  # In the end, we output the whole thing as an svg

# It works!!!!!!!

# Now I want to loop through the same to create svg files for multiple years
# But first I want to create some folders for my svgs, pngs and annotated pngs
mkdir svg png annotated

# I want the thing only for select years, so I can write it like this

# for year in 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020
# If I want to do a range, I will do it like this
for ((year=1980;year<=2020;year++))
# in shell scripts, we start a block of actions in the loop with do

###  	Run the for loop as a .sh file (kinda like this one). 	 ###
### as `bash script.sh` or whatever the file name is in cmder 	 ###

	# I want by text to be black so that.
	# Then font size is called -pointsize
